## ALL ABOUT THE PROJECT

_This project is conduct as a final project for **Introduction to Survival Analysis**_ course.

| **Survival Analysis on Breast Cancer Patients using Cox Proportional Hazard Model Method** |
|----|

In this project, we analyze the data we have for a breast cancer. The **objectives** of this analysis are below:
1. Identify the significant clinical and molecular factors which affect the patients survival.
2. Build a survival model for the patients using Cox Proportional Hazard Model
3. Giving recommendations based on the result of the analysis to be use when taking clinical decision.


<br />

`The conclusion from this project:`
1. Radiotherapy and the neoplasm are affecting the patients survival.
2. The best model is the one without any interactions
3. The individual who got radiotheraphy has death risk 0.47 times lower than who does not get it
4. The individual who has neoplasm has death probability 9.25 times bigger than who does not have it.
