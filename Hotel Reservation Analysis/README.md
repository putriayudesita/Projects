## ALL ABOUT THE PROJECT

_This project is conduct as a final project for **Data Mining and Visualization**_ course.

In this project, we analyze the data we have for a hotel reservation which contains many variables with vary data types. The **objective** of this analysis is to obtain the best classification method to predict the cancellation of customers. Within this project, we used 4 methods that have been compared which are:
* Random Forest
* Neural Network
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine

<br />

`The conclusion from this project:`
1. **Random Forest** is the best method to be used for this dataset.
2. The accuracy for RF is the highest among the other methods.
3. Accuracy for training and testing with Repeated Holdout is 90%.
4. ROC-AUC is at 96%.
5. Sensitivity is at 89% and specificity is at 90%.

<br />
Aside from the analysis, we also create a dashboard for the data using `rshiny`.
